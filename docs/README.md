# Flow Designer documentation

This project is the web UI for the existing Atlas Control Plane. It is not a second control plane.

## User guide

- [Web User Guide — English](guides/web-user-guide-en.md)
- [คู่มือใช้งานผ่านเว็บ — ภาษาไทย](guides/web-user-guide-th.md)

The two guides above are for operators: navigation, fleet, jobs, the workflow
editor, test runs, runs and approvals, triggers, deliveries, the artifact
ledger, usage, and audit — including what is deliberately out of scope today
(ad-hoc job composition, run file uploads, and solution-pack import/export
remain API-only; see
[Atlas's own Web User Guide](https://github.com/kaebmoo/atlas-control-plane/blob/main/docs/guides/web-user-guide-en.md)
for the minimal embedded ops console that ships with Atlas itself).

## Application integration guide

For developers building an application **on top of** a workflow rather than
operating one. Covers the boundary between your application's backend, Atlas,
and thClaws, the five Atlas calls involved, and what the generated **Observed**
contract can and cannot promise.

- [Calling a workflow from your own application — English](guides/application-integration-en.md)
- [เรียกใช้ workflow จากแอปพลิเคชันของคุณเอง — ภาษาไทย](guides/application-integration-th.md)

## Scope boundary

The frontend owns presentation, navigation, query caching, form state, optimistic UI where safe, and transport adapters. Atlas owns persistence, authentication, authorization, worker credentials, routing, workflow execution, event history, artifacts, triggers, deliveries, audit, and usage.

The phase plan is intentionally sequential. Do not start a later phase until the preceding gate is reviewed and confirmed.
